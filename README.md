# S3-Docker-Setup
##### *NOTE: All this setup is not mine I copied this from a Youtuber [WebDevCody](https://github.com/webdevcody). So please give him love for this.*

Copy all the files and then execute `docker compose build` to lay the base of the docker and then `docker compose up` to run the image. 

Error: If you face any error like No s3rver module found make sure you installed it in your project and If you still face the error then add ( "type":"module", ) in your package.json file.
